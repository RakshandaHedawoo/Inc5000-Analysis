    "1. From the descriptive statistics, it is clear that as a variability measure i.e. the standard deviation of revenue data is huge, this suggests that the revenue of the companies varies a lot.This might be the case because the companies on the INC 5000 list are a mixture of both well established firms and startups. \n",
    "1. Establishes firms started operating and generating revenue before 2014, so they will definitely generate a lot of revenue as compared to some startups that originated within the time period of 2013-2014. They will have low revenue as compared to these big firms.\n",
    "1. The above inference can be backed up by the fact that only 13.5 % of the companies founded before 2015 have generated revenue greater than $50 million, that means the rest of the companies have generated less than 50 million dollars.\n",
    "1. Also, the variability in the revenue could be big due to the various industries listed on the website. Each industry sector's revenue model is different.\n",
    "1. For example the revenue generated in the Food & Beverage industry will definitely vary with the revenue generated in Logistics and Transportation. As both the industries work in a very different way and both require different skill sets to work.\n",

This might be the case because the companies originating in this region are all well-established firms; generating high revenue as compared to the other companies in the same industry.\n",
